All IEOR majors are required to take at least six credits of IEOR technical electives, and the total number of technical credits required varies by major. \n\u2022 **Management Electives:** These courses cover topics like project management, finance, or marketing and are intended to provide you with valuable business context for your technical skills.

Columbia Engineering undergraduates typically study abroad during the spring semester of their sophomore year. Alternatively, you might choose to study abroad during the summer through a Columbia-sponsored program. During certain study abroad programs, students are able to fulfill some of their engineering prerequisite requirements and/or humanities core requirements. For more information about available programs, please visit the Programs page on the Center for Undergraduate Engagement website, available here: {study_abroad_opportunities}.\n\nWe would be happy to meet with you to discuss which programs might be best suited for your academic and professional interests, as well as to talk about which requirements can be fulfilled abroad.\n\nWarm regards,\nAcademic Advising Team",

Barnard College offers several pathways in conjunction with Columbia Engineering, including a BA/MS in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research. For all of the 4+1 pathways, students must maintain a GPA at or above 3.5 and apply by February 15 of their junior year. Applications for the Engineering 4+1 Pathways are submitted directly to Columbia Engineering. No standardized test scores are required for 4+1 applicants.\n\nFor the BS/MS in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, students must complete the following prerequisites by the end of their fall semester of their junior year: Multivariable Calculus for Engineering and Applied Science (or Calculus III), Linear Algebra, Introduction to Probability & Statistics, and Foundations of Data Science. The majors with requirements that most closely track with these prerequisites are Economics & Math and Economics & Statistics. Other majors may apply to the pathway but students should discuss their plans with the Barnard faculty lead to assess their readiness for masters level engineering classes and the strength of their application. Successful applicants have extensive quantitative course work through their major or minor. \n\nFor more information, please visit the 4+1 Pathways page on the Barnard website, available here: {barnard_four_plus_one}. We would be happy to meet with you to discuss how your undergraduate coursework might translate to the MS degree.\n\nBest regards,\nAcademic Advising Team",

This program allows students from affiliated liberal arts colleges to earn two degrees: a Bachelor of Arts from their home institution and a Bachelor of Science from Columbia Engineering.\n\nHere's how the program works:\n• Students typically spend three years at their home institution completing liberal arts requirements and pre-engineering coursework.\n• Students then transfer to Columbia Engineering for two years to complete their engineering degree.\n• Upon completion, students receive both a BA from their original college and a BS from Columbia.\n\nKey requirements:\n• Strong academic record with a recommended GPA of 3.3 or higher\n• Completion of prerequisite courses in mathematics (through differential equations), physics, chemistry, and computer science\n• Recommendation from your home institution's Combined Plan advisor\n• Application typically submitted during the fall of your third year\n\nFor detailed information about prerequisites, affiliated colleges, and application deadlines, please visit the Combined Plan page on the Columbia Engineering website: {combined_plan_link}\n\nWe would be happy to meet with you to discuss whether the Combined Plan is a good fit for your academic goals.\n\nBest regards,\nAcademic Advising Team",
